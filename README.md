# PyDic

A smart application which uses voice recognition technology to find out information about a certain word. 

# How to Run locally

# How it works

* User queries the definition of word in CLI
* word's meaning is displayed if it exist in database 
* otherwise it searches for the closest match of the queried word
* if closest match found by program is the required word, it prints word's meaning

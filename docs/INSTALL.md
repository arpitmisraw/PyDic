This document is mainly for one to understand the installation procedure.

There is a shell script which exists for automating the whole installation process.

But first, before going to that, make sure you clone the github repository on your local machine

git clone "https://github.com/mrsaicharan1/PyDic"

Then go to the PyDic folder and go into the "build" folder inside PyDic.

Once you're there make sure your path on the terminal is "...../PyDic/build"

After checking that, type ". build.sh" in the command line and you're done!

The whole thing is setup for you in virtualenv! It'll take care of all dependencies being installed too :)

You'll directly be asked to enter a word after running ". build.sh" which means you'll directly enter the main application after running the shellscript.
